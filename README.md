# wordle
Wordle solver tool and basic 5-letter English word stats

The GUI only takes in responses in caps. 

E.g. for the letter inputs use A, B, C, D, etc. and for words use APPLE, RAISE, CRANE, etc. 
Lowercase letters will not be accepted. Might add that functionality in later if I have time.

The second column of the solver applet requires the colors to be inputed after you made your guess. 

E.g. if the word you inputted was CRANE and the colors returned were Black, Black, Yellow, Yellow, 
Green, you input this as BBYYG where Black = B, Yellow = Y, and Green = G.

The application is not perfect and may have some bugs, so use at your own discretion.

Included is a .exe in dist folder that can run the current build of the application directly without any 
need to deal with any code, the file name is ridiculous on purpose, long story.

Please submit any issues you may discover so that I can look into solving them, always down to make my 
software better.

Happy Wordling!
